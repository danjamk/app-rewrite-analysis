# Legacy Code and Technical Debt
## A model to help decide to refactor or rewrite

After years of passionate investment into an application, there comes a time when you will be challenged
to push on and refactor a problematic platform or to rewrite it.  This is a difficult and scary proposition.

Being an engineer, I wanted to create a model that could help with the decision process.  Included here
is a simple model you can take and modify to enhance your own analysis.  

Note, there are MANY intertwined factors that should influence your decision, and this analysis is only a small part.
Its accuracy is limited, but the mental model and the thought process that goes into applying it to your
situation can be very valuable in the process.

The Excell based model is here: [Rebuild-analysis-model.xlsx](Rebuild-analysis-model.xlsx)

Please comment or provide feedback if you use it.

**Note:** The specific numerical progressions shown in the cost curves (e.g., 1x â†’ 7.5x â†’ 18x multipliers) represent synthesized patterns based on these research findings rather than direct empirical measurements from a single study. The research consistently shows that technical debt significantly increases development costs over time, but specific quantitative progressions vary by organization and context.
